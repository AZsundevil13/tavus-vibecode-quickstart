# Security Guidelines

## Overview

This AI therapy application handles sensitive mental health data and requires robust security measures. This document outlines security best practices and implementation details.

## Security Architecture

### Data Protection
- **End-to-end encryption** for all video communications via Daily.co
- **No persistent storage** of conversation data
- **Ephemeral sessions** - all data is discarded after session ends
- **API key protection** - never exposed in client-side code

### Authentication & Authorization
- **API token validation** with format checking
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Session management** with secure token handling
- **CORS protection** for API endpoints

### Network Security
- **HTTPS enforcement** in production
- **Content Security Policy** headers
- **HSTS** for transport security
- **Secure headers** (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)

## Implementation Details

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required - Never commit these to version control
VITE_TAVUS_API_KEY=your_secure_api_key
VITE_TAVUS_REPLICA_ID=your_replica_id

# Optional security enhancements
VITE_CSP_NONCE=random_nonce_value
```

### API Security
- Input sanitization for all user inputs
- URL validation for conversation endpoints
- Rate limiting (10 API calls per minute, 5 conversations per 5 minutes)
- Error message sanitization to prevent information leakage

### Client-Side Security
- XSS prevention through input sanitization
- CSRF protection via SameSite cookies
- Secure token storage in localStorage with validation
- Content Security Policy enforcement

## Security Headers

### Production Headers
```
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=()
Content-Security-Policy: [detailed policy in _headers file]
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

## Vulnerability Management

### Regular Security Tasks
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning (`npm audit`)
- [ ] Security header verification
- [ ] SSL certificate monitoring
- [ ] Access log analysis
- [ ] Error rate monitoring

### Security Testing
```bash
# Run security audit
npm run security-audit

# Check for outdated dependencies
npm outdated

# Analyze bundle for security issues
npm run analyze
```

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Types
1. **Data Breach**: Unauthorized access to user data
2. **API Abuse**: Excessive or malicious API usage
3. **XSS/Injection**: Code injection attempts
4. **DDoS**: Denial of service attacks

### Response Procedures
1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Stop ongoing attack
4. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
5. **Documentation**: Record incident details
6. **Review**: Improve security measures

## Compliance Considerations

### HIPAA Compliance
- **Encryption**: All data in transit and at rest
- **Access Controls**: Proper authentication and authorization
- **Audit Logs**: Comprehensive logging of access and changes
- **Business Associate Agreements**: With third-party services
- **Risk Assessment**: Regular security evaluations

### Privacy Regulations
- **GDPR**: European data protection compliance
- **CCPA**: California privacy law compliance
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data
- **Right to Deletion**: Ability to remove user data
- **Consent Management**: Proper user consent handling

## Third-Party Security

### Tavus API Security
- Secure API key management
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

- Security header violations
- SSL certificate expiration

## Development Security

### Secure Coding Practices
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output encoding
- Proper error handling
- Secure session management
- Regular security reviews

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Proper input validation
- [ ] Secure API calls
- [ ] Error handling without data leakage
- [ ] Proper authentication checks

## Deployment Security

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Security audit passed
